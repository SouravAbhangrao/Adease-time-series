**Recommendations**

• Prioritize English-language pages due to their low MAPE and high mean visits, making them
optimal for advertising efforts to maximize reach and effectiveness.

• Avoid advertising on Chinese-language pages unless there’s a specific marketing strategy tailored for Chinese populations, as they have the lowest number of visits.

• Russian-language pages present a promising opportunity for high conversion rates with their
decent number of visits and low MAPE, if utilized effectively.

• Despite having the second-highest number of visits, Spanish-language pages exhibit the highest MAPE, suggesting that advertisements on these pages may not effectively reach the intended audience.

• French, German, and Japanese-language pages show moderate levels of visits and MAPE. Depending on the target customers, consider advertising campaigns on these pages to capitalize
on their potential reach and conversion rates.
